<h1>Romanian salary calculator</h1>

<p>This small program calculates the basic salary in Romania. The basic salary 
does not include overtime worked or other rewards obtained as a result of the 
activity performed. It is only about the basic salary that is in the employment 
contract. More specifically, if a gross salary of 10,000 lei is stipulated in the employment 
contract, the program will calculate the net salary after the employer 
and, the employee pay to the state the related and mandatory taxes imposed by the Romanian
legislation vis a vis the salary law.</p>

<p>Also is calculating the other way around, that is, if you want to check what
the gross salary is, depending on the net salary, you just have to enter the value of the
net salary, and you will find out what is the gross salary, and also detailed what are the related taxes
to the state.</p>

<p>The program has also implemented a reset option to recalculate new values, 
for gross or net.</p>
