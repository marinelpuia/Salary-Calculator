<h1>Romanian salary calculator</h1>
<p>This small program calculates the basic salary in Romania. The basic salary does not include overtime worked or other rewards obtained as a result of the activity performed. It is only about the basic salary
  that is in the employment contract.</p>
  
<p>More specifically, if a gross salary of 10,000 lei, is stipulated in the employment contract, the program will calculate the net salary after the employer and, the employee pay to the state the related and
mandatory taxes imposed by the Romanian legislation, regarding the salary law.</p>

<p>Also is calculating the other way around, that is, if you want to check what the gross salary is, depending on the net salary, you just have to enter the value of the net salary, and you will find out what is
the gross salary, and also detailed what are the related taxes to the state.</p>

<p>The program has also implemented a reset option to recalculate new values, for gross or net.</p>
